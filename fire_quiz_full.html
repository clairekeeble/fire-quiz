["Fixed-temperature detector", "Rate-of-rise detector", "Photoelectric detector", "Combination ionization detector"], "answer": "Rate-of-rise detector"}, {"question": "What is a limitation of Class B fire alarm circuits?", "options": ["They cannot detect smoke", "A single wiring break may not trigger an alarm at the control panel", "They are more expensive than Class A circuits", "They only work with ionization detectors"], "answer": "A single wiring break may not trigger an alarm at the control panel"}, {"question": "Which extinguishing system is mentioned as an alternative to water-based systems?", "options": ["Carbon dioxide", "Nitrogen gas", "Water mist", "Sand"], "answer": "Carbon dioxide"}, {"question": "What is the purpose of an end-of-line resistor in a Class B fire alarm circuit?", "options": ["To increase voltage", "To monitor circuit integrity", "To reduce false alarms", "To detect heat"], "answer": "To monitor circuit integrity"}, {"question": "What are the four main stages of a fire?", "options": ["Smoke, flame, heat, explosion", "Incipient, smouldering, flame, heat", "Ignition, growth, flashover, decay", "Start, middle, peak, end"], "answer": "Ignition, growth, flashover, decay"}, {"question": "During which stage of a fire is smoke first visible?", "options": ["Incipient stage", "Smouldering stage", "Flame stage", "Heat stage"], "answer": "Incipient stage"}, {"question": "What is the primary cause of most fire fatalities?", "options": ["Burns", "Structural collapse", "Smoke inhalation", "Explosions"], "answer": "Smoke inhalation"}, {"question": "At what smoke level in the air can life no longer be sustained?", "options": ["2%", "6%", "10%", "15%"], "answer": "6%"}, {"question": "What is a key hazard during the heat stage of a fire?", "options": ["Toxic gases are released", "Structural steel can buckle", "Smoke becomes visible", "Flames become invisible"], "answer": "Structural steel can buckle"}, {"question": "What is the third leading cause of accidental death in Canada?", "options": ["Car accidents", "Poisoning", "Fire", "Falls"], "answer": "Fire"}, {"question": "Why is early detection of a fire important?", "options": ["It prevents the fire from starting", "It reduces damage and allows quicker extinguishment", "It eliminates the need for fire alarms", "It ensures the fire will not spread"], "answer": "It reduces damage and allows quicker extinguishment"}, {"question": "Which stage of a Class A fire is characterized by no visible smoke, flame, or heat?", "options": ["Smouldering stage", "Flame stage", "Incipient stage", "Heat stage"], "answer": "Incipient stage"}, {"question": "Which type of detector is most suitable for detecting the smouldering stage of a fire?", "options": ["Heat detector", "Photoelectric smoke detector", "Flame detector", "Ionization smoke detector"], "answer": "Photoelectric smoke detector"}, {"question": "In the flame stage of a fire, which fire signatures are present?", "options": ["Smoke only", "Heat only", "Flame and heat", "Smoke and flame only"], "answer": "Flame and heat"}, {"question": "What are the three essential components of the fire triangle?", "options": ["Fuel, water, heat", "Fuel, oxygen, heat", "Oxygen, smoke, flame", "Heat, carbon dioxide, fuel"], "answer": "Fuel, oxygen, heat"}, {"question": "Which additional component turns the fire triangle into the fire tetrahedron?", "options": ["Smoke", "Chain reaction", "Toxic gases", "Pressure"], "answer": "Chain reaction"}, {"question": "How can a fire be extinguished by "smothering"?", "options": ["By cooling the fuel below ignition temperature", "By removing oxygen from the fire", "By diluting the fuel source", "By stopping the chain reaction"], "answer": "By removing oxygen from the fire"}, {"question": "Which detector is most effective for sensing the incipient stage of a fire?", "options": ["Ionization smoke detector", "Heat detector", "Flame detector", "Photoelectric smoke detector"], "answer": "Photoelectric smoke detector"}, {"question": "What is a limitation of heat detectors in fire detection?", "options": ["They respond too quickly to flames", "They only activate when temperatures rise significantly", "They cannot detect smoke", "They require visible flames"], "answer": "They only activate when temperatures rise significantly"}, {"question": "What is the primary focus of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC)?", "options": ["Fire suppression techniques", "Maintenance of alarm systems", "Structural safety and building design requirements",
